# 💻 Front-End Web Development Projects (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript)

This repository focuses on web development projects built using the foundational triad: **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. These projects are perfect for mastering core front-end concepts, DOM manipulation, and responsive design without the complexity of modern frameworks or server-side languages.

## 🎯 Project Scope: Foundational Skills

The projects here illustrate how to build fully interactive, client-side applications using only browser-native technologies.

### 🌟 Core Projects

These projects focus on essential skills in structuring, styling, and adding interactivity.

* **Personal Portfolio Site:**
    * **Focus:** Semantic **HTML** structure, responsive **CSS** layout (Flexbox/Grid), and basic **JavaScript** for smooth scrolling or a simple contact form validation.
* **Simple Blog/Magazine Layout:**
    * **Focus:** Advanced **CSS** techniques, media queries for **responsiveness**, and good typographic practices.
* **To-Do List Application:**
    * **Focus:** Heavy use of **JavaScript** for **DOM manipulation** (adding, removing, editing list items), local storage integration for persistence.
    * 
* **Basic Landing Page with Modal:**
    * **Focus:** Creating visual appeal with **CSS animations** and using **JavaScript** to toggle visibility of elements (like a sign-up modal).
* **Calculator App:**
    * **Focus:** Handling user input, mathematical logic implementation purely in **JavaScript**.

### 🚀 API Integration & Advanced JS

These projects use only front-end code but connect to public, non-authenticated APIs for dynamic data.

* **Weather Application:**
    * **Focus:** Using the built-in **`fetch` API** in **JavaScript** to retrieve data (e.g., from OpenWeatherMap) and dynamically updating the HTML content.
* **Recipe or Quote Finder:**
    * **Focus:** Asynchronous **JavaScript** (`async/await`) to handle external data requests and error handling.
* **Image Gallery with Filtering:**
    * **Focus:** Complex **JavaScript** logic to filter and sort displayed items based on user selection, combined with efficient **CSS** transitions.
